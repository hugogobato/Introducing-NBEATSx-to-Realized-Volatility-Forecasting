Abstract
This paper explores the use of neural basis expansion analysis with exogenous variables 
(NBEATSx) in predicting daily stock realized volatility for various time steps. It compares
NBEATSxâ€™s forecasting accuracy and robustness with various commonly used models, namely 
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Neural Network (TCN), HAR, GARCH, and 
GJR-GARCH models. A total of six different stock indexes, three error measures and four 
statistical tests are used in this research, and three robustness tests are performed to test results of 
this paper. The findings of this study shows that NBEATSx yields statistically more accurate and 
robust forecasts than the other considered models. On average, NBEATSx produces forecasts that 
are respectively 13% and 8% more accurate for medium-term and long-term forecasting while
respectively being 43%, 60%, and 59% more robust for short-term, medium-term and long-term 
forecasting. Yet, it is worth mentioning that the superiority of NBEATSx regarding forecast 
accuracy is not clear with stock indexes from developing countrie
